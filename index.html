        <h3>Hello everyone!</h3> 
        <p>
            This is my <em>first</em> attempt at creating
            a website! Ill be posting a couple of recipes here to
            <strong><em>practice</strong></em> what i've learned so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've only learned a few things on html such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Basic lists</li>
                <li>Creating HTML structure</li>
                <li>And a few basic HTML tags</li>
                <li>etc...</li>
            </ul>
            <u>But hope to learn much more!</u>
        </p>
